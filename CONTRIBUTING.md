###Contributing
Our stack is Node.JS and MongoDB

You can run it locally or use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

###Clone the repo
First of all you need to clone this repository if you did not do it yet.
```
git clone https://github.com/asm-products/boxychat.git
cd boxychat
```
###Run BoxyChat with Vagrant

You need to start Vagrant, it will download and install everything that is needed.
```
vagrant up

```
Once the machine is ready you can jump in via SSH.
```
vagrant ssh

```
Vagrant will get the project's files and maps them to ```/home/vagrant/boxychat``` so you should enter that directory, install the packages and run the app.
```
cd boxychat
npm install
npm start

```

After this you can try boxychat at http://192.168.100.100:3000

###Run BoxyChat in local

All you need to do, you have Node.JS and MongoDB installed in local is the following
```
npm install
npm start

```

Now your app should be running at http://localhost:3000
